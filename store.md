<h3>Anki C++ study and review deck</h3>

Currently 570 Anki Cards about C++ programming. Some of these are front/back cards as well, so in total there will be 700+ different things it can ask you about.

I've used Anki almost daily for many years now, and the goal with these cards is to always memorize practical, realistic and applicable things that I've actually used during development, including cards for most of the STL algorithms. This is not a dump of thousands of factoids from some book.

Here are a couple of samples: [1](/assets/images/store/card1.png), [2](/assets/images/store/card2.png).

To use them, just make sure [Anki Desktop](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is installed and double-click the downloaded .apkg file. You can also open Anki Desktop, click File->Import and pick the received .apkg file. 

Make sure you use a valid e-mail when purchasing, as the deck will be sent to that e-mail address.
