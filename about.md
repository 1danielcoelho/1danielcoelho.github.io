<h2>me</h2>

![me](/assets/images/me.jpg "2014 me next to Neuschwanstein with Neuschwanstein cropped out")

I'm a senior software engineer with experience in C++, 3D, Unreal Engine and some biomedical engineering. Here is my full [CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

I'm sort of a generalist, and at the moment my main areas of interest are 3D graphics, space and AI.

<h2>this page</h2>

The main goal of this website is to get me embarassed for having an empty website, so that I feel more pressure to actually complete my side projects and write more. I'll probably write mostly about software engineering, but maybe about other stuff too.

I don't really like webdev so "I" "built" this using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and the [Hyde theme for Jekyll](https://github.com/poole/hyde). For post comments I used [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/), which is amazing and automatically redirects the comments onto a GitHub issue on the [repo](https://github.com/1danielcoelho/1danielcoelho.github.io) of this very page, for each post. This was all free (so far).

You can see the page source (as well as the cool GitHub issue comments) on [the page's repo](https://github.com/1danielcoelho/1danielcoelho.github.io). If you're going to do something similar, I recommend having a look at the [todo.md file](https://github.com/1danielcoelho/1danielcoelho.github.io/blob/main/todo.md) in there to check out a couple of fixes I've had to do to get this working.

Please forgive me about the Google Analytics script...
